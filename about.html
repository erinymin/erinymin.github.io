           <h1>about</h1>
           <p>this is an interactive website made for my ctc class with html and css coding. </p>
           <p>the phrase "things that help me fall asleep a little better" came from the idea that happiness is when there isn't anything to think about before going to sleep. </p>
           <p> using the concept, i created a library of things that i am grateful for. i gathered 100 images from pieces from my life, then i added personal narratives and added both of my languages for each image. </p>
           <p>in the future, i want to expand this project further and use it as an archival library for my memories. </p>
