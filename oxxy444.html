    <h1>About oxxy444</h1>
    <h2>Hello, my name is Roki Kim, founder of Oxxy and the executive exhibition director of the 2025 summer exhibition, “Oxxy n Friends.”
<br></br>
One constant question that occurred to me during the process of creating this exhibition was how to express the culture and the movement of the attempt to dream in a way that would be most assimilable for the Korean audience. How could I make the identity of Oxxy clear and easy to understand? 
    <br></br>
I aim to establish a clear consensus on the movement of Oxxy and its identity through the distinctiveness and relatability of the individual exhibitions by all the artists. To have a space be distinctive yet relatable means creation through freedom of thought and, thus, expression.
<br></br>      Viewers are invited to engage with the model, reflect on its textures and form, and consider the ways our bodies hold and express time.
<br></br>    

“Oxxy n Friends” showcases the distinctive taste and design language of 7 artists, influenced by the United States, Canada, Ghana, and Korea. From the rich sounds of a traditional Korean instrument, gayageum, to exploring your primal dreams through the idea of nostalgia and unedited photography to reconciliation and transformation from 2D to 3D through a visual dialogue between the past and future self, to the question of what makes someplace a home, to the expression of history and culture through daily bags, to explore pain within the growth, and finally, a study of the abstract through the abstract. 
<br></br>
Oxxy’s composition language is minimalism. The movement of Oxxy is timeless; therefore, the designs should be timeless as well—the consideration of trends yet the translation of how we create an arrangement honest to ourselves. 
<br></br>

To create a space that is otherworldly and excites sensations not often felt. To be able to overwhelm the audience and awaken them to their dreams to dream. Our attempt to dream of this eventual pursuit. 
<br></br>The eventual pursuit is only possible through the continuous attempt to do.
<br></br>It is my pleasure to introduce you to the 2025 summer exhibition, “Oxxy and Friends.”</h2>
